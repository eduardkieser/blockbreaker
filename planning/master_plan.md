# The Plan

This is where we record the proposed architecture, milestones and who works on what.

*Google Docs:*  
Git isn't a good place to host live documents that are expected to change multiple times per day, that's what google drive is for, however let's make a habit of adding links to the various documents here so that we have a central index to all our documentation from one place.
Also when adding a document link, make sure it's located in a shared folder that we all have access to.

* TODO: Review all similar projects online, note what we like and what we plan to do better. Write it up in a google doc and link it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0)
* TODO: Decide on tools. A typical open scource stack might look as follows:
    * fusion360 or onshape of the mechanical cad, 
    * kicad for electronic schematics and PCB design.
    * Python Notebooks or [smathstudio](https://smath.com/en-US/view/SMathStudio/download/) for "napkin calculations"
    * Python for device software
    * Python + some framework for the website.

### Things to avoid:  
* Non free software or software with restrictive licensing (looking at you MATLAB).

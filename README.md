# blockbreaker
A system for crowd sourcing properties of 3D printed materials.

<More detail about what we are doing>

Basic rules.
* Don't commit to master/main.
* Do create a branch, then a merge request.
* Don't approve your own MRs (as far as possible)
* Do frequently review, accept and merge open MRs to main.
* Don't underestimate the value of good version controll.
* Don't commit large files (png/jpeg images/binaries ect) to git. Git rememberers everything that was added (even if you delete it).
